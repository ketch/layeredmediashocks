abstract = {We study time step restrictions due to linear stability constraints of Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin methods on triangular grids. The scalar advection equation is discretized in space by the Discontinuous Galerkin method with either the Lax-Friedrichs flux or the upwind flux, and integrated in time with various Runge-Kutta schemes designed for linear wave propagation problems or non-linear applications. Von-Neumann-like analyses are performed on structured periodic grids made up of congruent elements, to investigate the influence of element shape on the stability restrictions. We assess CFL conditions based on different element size measures, among which only the radius of the inscribed circle and the shortest height prove appropriate, although they are not totally independent of the triangle shape. We explain their general behaviour with respect to element quality, and report the corresponding Courant numbers with both types of flux and polynomial order p ranging from 1 to 10, for use as guidelines in practical simulations. We also compare the performance of the Lax-Friedrichs flux and the upwind flux, and we draw general conclusions about the relative computational efficiency of RK schemes. The application of CFL conditions to two examples involving respectively in unstructured and a hybrid grid confirms our results, although it shows that local stability criteria tend to yield too restrictive conditions.},

@article{Zhuang2003,
abstract = {In heterogeneous media, scattering due to interfaces/microstructure between dissimilar materials could play an important role in shock wave dissipation and dispersion. In this work, the influence of interface scattering on finite-amplitude shock waves was experimentally investigated by impacting flyer plates onto periodically layered polycarbonate/6061 aluminum, polycarbonate/304 stainless steel and polycarbonate/glass composites. Experimental results (obtained using velocity interferometer and stress gage) show that these periodically layered composites can support steady structured shock waves. Due to interface scattering, the effective shock viscosity increases with the increase of interface impedance mismatch, and decreases with the increase of interface density (interface area per unit volume) and loading amplitude. For the composites studied here, the strain rate within the shock front is roughly proportional to the square of the shock stress. This indicates that layered composites have much larger shock viscosity due to the interface/microstructure scattering in comparison with the increase of shock strain rate by the fourth power of the shock stress for homogeneous metals. Experimental results also show that due to the scattering effects, shock propagation in the layered composites is dramatically slowed down and the shock speed in composites can be lower than that either of its components.},

The scheme is of predictor–corrector type, with a MUSCL scheme following as a special case. The crucial ingredients are an entropy stable approximate Riemann solver and a new spatial reconstruction that ensures positivity of mass density and pressure. For multidimensional MHD, a new discrete form of the Powell source terms is vital to ensure the stability properties. The numerical examples show that the scheme has superior stability compared to standard schemes, while maintaining accuracy. In particular, the method can handle very low values of pressure (i.e. low plasma $\beta$ or high Mach numbers) and low mass densities.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the construction of non-oscillatory schemes of very high order of accuracy in space and time, to solve non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws. The schemes result from extending the ADER approach, which is related to the ENO/WENO methodology. Our schemes are conservative, one-step, explicit and fully discrete, requiring only the computation of the inter-cell fluxes to advance the solution by a full time step; the schemes have optimal stability condition. To compute the intercell flux in one space dimension we solve a generalised Riemann problem by reducing it to the solution a sequence of m conventional Riemann problems for the kth spatial derivatives of the solution, with k=0, 1,..., m-1, where m is arbitrary and is the order of the accuracy of the resulting scheme. We provide numerical examples using schemes of up to fifth order of accuracy in both time and space.},

abstract = {We develop a new family of well-balanced path-conservative quadrature-free one-step ADER finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured meshes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms. The fully discrete formulation is derived using the recently developed framework of explicit one-step PNPM schemes of arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time for conservative hyperbolic systems [Dumbser M, Balsara D, Toro EF, Munz CD. A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes. J Comput Phys 2008;227:8209–53]. The two key ingredients of our high order approach are: first, the high order accurate PNPM reconstruction operator on unstructured meshes, using the WENO strategy presented in [Dumbser M, K\"{a}ser M, Titarev VA Toro EF. Quadrature-free non-oscillatory finite volume schemes on unstructured meshes for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. J Comput Phys 2007;226:204–43] to ensure monotonicity at discontinuities, and second, a local space–time Galerkin scheme to predict the evolution of the reconstructed polynomial data inside each element during one time step to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. This approach is also able to deal with stiff source terms as shown in [Dumbser M, Enaux C, Toro EF. Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws. J Comput Phys 2008;227:3971–4001]. These two key ingredients are combined with the recently developed path-conservative methods of Par\'{e}s [Par\'{e}s C. Numerical methods for nonconservative hyperbolic systems: a theoretical framework. SIAM J Numer Anal 2006;44:300–21] and Castro et al. [Castro MJ, Gallardo JM, Par\'{e}s C. High-order finite volume schemes based on reconstruction of states for solving hyperbolic systems with nonconservative products. Applications to shallow-water systems. Math Comput 2006;75:1103–34] to treat the non-conservative products properly. We show applications of our method to the two-layer shallow water equations as well as applications to the recently published depth-averaged two-fluid flow model of Pitman and Le [Pitman EB, Le L.

abstract = {Time dependent problems frequently pose challenges in areas of science and engineering dealing with numerical analysis, scientific computation, mathematical models, and most importantly--numerical experiments intended to analyze physical behavior and test design. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods addresses these various industrial considerations in a pragmatic and detailed manner, giving special attention to time dependent problems in its coverage of the derivation and analysis of numerical methods for computational approximations to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The book is written in two parts. Part I discusses problems with periodic solutions; Part II proceeds to discuss initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations and numerical methods for them. The problems with periodic solutions have been chosen because they allow the application of Fourier analysis without the complication that arises from the infinite domain for the corresponding Cauchy problem. Furthermore, the analysis of periodic problems provides necessary conditions when constructing methods for initial boundary value problems. Much of the material included in Part II appears for the first time in this book. The authors draw on their own interests and combined extensive experience in applied mathematics and computer science to bring about this practical and useful guide. They provide complete discussions of the pertinent theorems and back them up with examples and illustrations. For physical scientists, engineers, or anyone who uses numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena, this invaluable guide is destined to become a constant companion. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations. What Every Physical Scientist and Engineer Needs to Know About Time Dependent Problems . . . Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods covers the analysis of numerical methods for computing approximate solutions to partial differential equations for time dependent problems. This original book includes for the first time a concrete discussion of initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations. The authors have redone many of these results especially for this volume, including theorems, examples, and over one hundred illustrations. The book takes some less-than-obvious approaches to developing its material: * Treats differential equations and numerical methods with a parallel development, thus achieving a more useful analysis of numerical methods * Covers hyperbolic equations in particularly great detail * Emphasizes error bounds and estimates, as well as the sufficient results needed to justify the methods used for applications Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is written for physical scientists and engineers who use numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena. It is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations.},

@article{Vigoureux1992,
abstract = {The experimental resolution that is obtained with a near-field microscope by optical tunneling detection is far beyond the Rayleigh criterion. We discuss the principal physical characteristics of this superresolution. Three different examples are presented. They show that the resolution increases as the collector width and collector-to-object distance decrease. It is interesting to note that, in the near-field microscope, as in all local probe microscopes, the resolution cannot be defined from the characteristics of the microscope only. In all tunnel devices the detector cannot be separated from the object. The superresolution that can be obtained results from this fact. This paper also points out the importance ofevanescent waves in near-field optics and makes the connection between resolving power and evanescent fields.},

@article{El2005,
abstract = {We present a way to deal with dispersion-dominated "shock-type" transition in the absence of completely integrable structure for the systems that one may characterize as strictly hyperbolic regularized by a small amount of dispersion. The analysis is performed by assuming that the dispersive shock transition between two different constant states can be modeled by an expansion fan solution of the associated modulation (Whitham) system for the short-wavelength nonlinear oscillations in the transition region (the so-called Gurevich-Pitaevskii problem). We consider both single-wave and bidirectional systems. The main mathematical assumption is that of hyperbolicity of the Whitham system for the solutions of our interest. By using general properties of the Whitham averaging for a certain class of nonlinear dispersive systems and specific features of the Cauchy data prescription on characteristics we derive a set of transition conditions for the dispersive shock, actually bypassing full integration of the modulation equations. Along with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified KdV (mKdV) equations as model examples, we consider a nonintegrable system describing fully nonlinear ion-acoustic waves in collisionless plasma. In all cases our transition conditions are in complete agreement with previous analytical and numerical results.},

@article{simpson2010,
abstract = {We consider the one-dimensional propagation of electromagnetic waves in a weakly nonlinear and low-contrast spatially inhomogeneous medium with no energy dissipation. We focus on the case of a periodic medium, in which dispersion enters only through the (Floquet-Bloch) spectral band dispersion associated with the periodic structure; chromatic dispersion (time-nonlocality of the polarization) is neglected. Numerical simulations show that for initial conditions of wave-packet type (a plane wave of fixed carrier frequency multiplied by a slow varying, spatially localized function) very long-lived spatially localized coherent soliton-like structures emerge, whose character is that of a slowly varying envelope of a train of shocks. We call this structure an envelope carrier-shock train. The structure of the solution violates the oft-assumed nearly monochromatic wave packet structure, whose envelope is governed by the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCME). The inconsistency and inaccuracy of NLCME lies in the neglect of all (infinitely many) resonances except for the principle resonance induced by the initial carrier frequency. We derive, via a nonlinear geometrical optics expansion, a system of nonlocal integro-differential equations governing the coupled evolution of backward and forward propagating waves. These equations incorporate effects of all resonances. In a periodic medium, these equations may be expressed as a system of infinitely many coupled mode equations, which we call the extended nonlinear coupled mode system (xNLCME). Truncating xNLCME to include only the principle resonances leads to the classical NLCME. Numerical simulations of xNLCME demonstrate that it captures both large scale features, related to third harmonic generation, and fine scale carrier shocks features of the nonlinear periodic Maxwell equations.},

It is shown how the order of a RK-method depends on the error constants of its stages, and the conditions (nonlinear equations) for order p are generated from a very simple recursion.},

@article{Ascher2007,
abstract = {Many recent algorithmic approaches involve the construction of a differential equation model for computational purposes, typically
 by introducing an artificial time variable. The actual computational model involves a discretization of the now time-dependent differential system, usually
 employing forward Euler. The resulting dynamics of such an algorithm is then a discrete dynamics, and it is expected to be
 “close enough” to the dynamics of the continuous system (which is typically easier to analyze) provided that small – hence
 many – time steps, or iterations, are taken. Indeed, recent papers in inverse problems and image processing routinely report
 results requiring thousands of iterations to converge. This makes one wonder if and how the computational modeling process
 can be improved to better reflect the actual properties sought.
 
 In this article we elaborate on several problem instances that illustrate the above observations. Algorithms may often lend
 themselves to a dual interpretation, in terms of a simply discretized differential equation with artificial time and in terms
 of a simple optimization algorithm; such a dual interpretation can be advantageous. We show how a broader computational modeling
 approach may possibly lead to algorithms with improved efficiency.},

We focus on the construction of explicit hybrid methods with nonnegative coefficients, which are a class of multistep methods incorporating a function evaluation at an off-step point. A series of new SSP methods are found. Among them, the low order methods are more efficient than some well known SSP Runge–Kutta or linear multistep methods. In particular, we present some fifth to seventh order methods with nonnegative coefficients, which have healthy CFL coefficients. Finally, some numerical experiments on the Burgers equation are given.},

abstract = {New Runge-Kutta methods for method of lines solution of systems of ordinary differential equations arising from discretizations of spatial derivatives in hyperbolic equations, by Chebyshev or modified Chebyshev methods, are introduced. These Runge-Kutta methods optimize the time step necessary for stable solutions, while holding dispersion and dissipation fixed. It is found that maximizing dispersion minimizes dissipation, and vice versa. Optimal methods with respect to large stability intervals on the imaginary axis and with respect to the eigenvalue spectra of the underlying pseudospectral discretizations are developed. In the latter case, stability regions are optimized to include the outliers of the spatial operators. Performance on a model problem in computational aeroacoustics is evaluated. The optimized schemes have two more function evaluations per timestep than the standard fourth order Runge-Kutta method, but allow timesteps up to 1.7 times larger.

@article{albrecht1996,
abstract = {In an earlier paper [Albrecht, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 24 (1987), pp. 391-406] Runge-Kutta methods were treated as (composite) linear methods. The resulting linear theory is elementary yielding the order conditions as orthogonal relations from a recursion. This paper further extends this approach and discusses its implications. It is extended to Fehlberg forms, and the global as well as the stage errors are given in great detail, including a new presentation of the principal error function that simplifies error minimization. The orthogonal structure of the order conditions has many advantages; it provides, in particular, a powerful strategy for existence proofs and facilitates the calculation of RK-methods. The recursion, which, originally, was designed to generate the order conditions, is considerably generalized by mappings and becomes a major tool also for the classical theory. It can be used for a recursive generation of rooted trees; also Butcher's elementary differentials and weights as well as his order conditions can be obtained recursively. To this purpose, the elementary weights are reformulated, and the rooted trees are complemented by "blossoms." The whole approach extends to Rosenbrock methods.},

Their results strongly indicate that diagonally split Runge-Kutta methods break the order barrier p less than or equal to 1 for unconditional contractivity in the maximum norm. In this paper we investigate the effect of the requirement of unconditional contractivity in the maximum norm on the accuracy of a diagonally split Runge-Kutta method. Besides the classical order p, we deal with an order of accuracy r which is relevant to the case where the method is applied to dissipative initial value problems that are arbitrarily stiff We show that if a diagonally split Runge-Kutta method is unconditionally contractive in the maximum norm, then it has orders p, r which satisfy p less than or equal to 4, r less than or equal to 1.},

@article{ferracina2005a,
abstract = {In the literature, on the numerical solution of nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations, much attention has been paid to numerical processes which have the favourable property of being total variation bounded (TVB). A popular approach to guaranteeing the TVB property consists in demanding that the process has the stronger property of being total variation diminishing (TVD). For Runge-Kutta methods-applied to semi-discrete approximations of partial differential equations-conditions on the time step were established which guarantee the TVD property; see, e.g., [J. Comput. Phys. 77 (1988) 439; Math. Comp. 67 (1998) 73; SIAM Rev. 43 (2001) 89; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. (2002), in press; Higueras, Tech. Report, Universidad Publica de Navarra, 2002; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 40 (2002) 469]. These conditions were derived under the assumption that the simple explicit Euler time stepping process is TVD. However, for various important semi-discrete approximations, the Euler process is TVB but not TVD-see, e.g., [Math. Comp. 49 (1987) 105; Math. Comp. 52 (1989) 411]. Accordingly, the above stepsize conditions for RungeKutta methods are not directly relevant to such approximations, and there is a need for stepsize restrictions with a wider range of applications. In this paper, we propose a general theory yielding stepsize restrictions which cover a larger class of semidiscrete approximations than covered thus far in the literature. In particular, our theory gives stepsize restrictions, for general Runge-Kutta methods, which guarantee total-variation-boundedness in situations where the Euler process is TVB but not TVD.

abstract = {Jackiewicz and Tracogna [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 32 (1995) 1390-1427] proposed a general formulation of two step Runge-Kutta (TSRK) methods. Using formulas for two-step pairs of TSRK methods constructed in [Japan JIAM 19 (2002) 227-248], Jackiewicz and Verner obtain results for order 8 pairs that fail to show this designated order. Hairer and Warmer [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 34 (1997) 2087-2089] identify the problem by using B-series to formulate a complete set of order conditions for TSRK methods, and emphasize that special starting methods are necessary for the first step of implementation. They observe that for methods with stage order at least p - 1, and design order p, starting methods of order at least p are sufficient. In this paper, the more general challenge to provide correct starting values for methods of low stage-order is met by showing how perturbed starting values should be selected for methods of order 6 and stage-order 3. The approach is sufficiently general that it may (and later will) be provided for such methods of higher orders. Evidence of the accompanying improvement in the implementation of TSRK methods illustrates that carefully designed starting methods are essential for efficient production codes based on methods of low stage-order.

These methods have a nonlinear stability property that makes them suitable for the time integration of ODEs that arise from a method of lines approximation of hyperbolic conservation laws. Basically, this stability property is a monotonicity property for the internal stages and the numerical solution. Recently Ferracina and Spijker have established a link between stepsize restrictions for monotonicity and the already known stepsize restrictions for contractivity. Hence the extensive research on contractivity can be transferred to the SSP context. In this paper we consider monotonicity issues for arbitrary norms and linear and nonlinear problems. We collect and review some known results and relate them with the ones obtained in the SSP context.},

abstract = {In this paper we construct numerical schemes of high order of accuracy for hyperbolic balance law systems with spatially variable flux function and a source term of the geometrical type. We start with the original finite difference characteristiewise weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes and then we create new schemes by modifying the flux formulations (locally Lax-Friedrichs and Roe with entropy fix) in order to account for the spatially variable flux, and by decomposing the source term in order to obtain balance between numerical approximations of the flux gradient and of the source term. We apply so extended WENO schemes to the one-dimensional open channel flow equations and to the one-dimensional elastic wave equations. In particular, we prove that in these applications the new schemes are exactly consistent with steady-state solutions from an appropriately chosen subset. Experimentally obtained orders of accuracy of the extended and original WENO schemes are almost identical on a convergence test. Other presented test problems illustrate the improvement of the proposed schemes relative to the original WENO schemes combined with the pointwise source term evaluation. As expected, the increase in the formal order of accuracy of applied WENO reconstructions in all the tests causes visible increase in the high resolution properties of the schemes.

@article{higueras2005a,
abstract = {Over the last few years a great effort has been made to develop monotone high order explicit Runge-Kutta methods by means of their Shu-Osher representations. In this context, the stepsize restriction to obtain numerical monotonicity is normally computed using the optimal representation. In this paper we extend the Shu-Osher representations for any Runge-Kutta method giving sufficient conditions for monotonicity. We show how optimal Shu-Osher representations can be constructed from the Butcher tableau of a Runge-Kutta method. The optimum stepsize restriction for monotonicity is given by the radius of absolute monotonicity of the Runge-Kutta method [L. Ferracina and M. N. Spijker, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 42 (2004), pp. 1073-1093], and hence if this radius is zero, the method is not monotone. In the Shu-Osher representation, methods with zero radius require negative coefficients, and to deal with them, an extra associate problem is considered. In this paper we interpret these schemes as representations of perturbed Runge-Kutta methods. We extend the concept of radius of absolute monotonicity and give sufficient conditions for monotonicity. Optimal representations can be constructed from the Butcher tableau of a perturbed Runge-Kutta method.},
