Hi David,

I like the new draft of the paper!

A few comments:

You've dropped the questions Q1 and Q2 from the introduction but still refer
to them later, e.g. in the first sentence of Sec. 3 and in the Conclusions.

On page 9 I added a definition of LY problem.

On page 10 when talking about Clawpack:  "This lower order accurate solution
shows significant numerical errors."  I modified this to say what order is
expected and also moved up the sentence about the order used in Sharpclaw.

Table 1, I fixed the caption to mention Sharpclaw.

Figure 10: can we introduce a symbol for the cases where entropy increased?
The ylabel on this graph should be $|\Delta \eta / \eta_0|$ with abs value?

Figure 12: would it be clearer to use a contour plot here rather than a
pcolor plot?  I find this hard to interpret and in particular it's not clear
if there's a sharp cutoff somewhere.  Presumably it should be at 
 \log_2(\rho_B) + \log_2(K_B) \approx \log_2(6.25)
and perhaps we should also plot that line?

At the end of Sec. 3 I think we need to state some conclusions about what is
seen in these figures.

In Fig. 13 should the xlabel be $Z_B$?  Again there should be abs value in
the ylabel?   

I'm not quite sure how to interpret this figure.  For each Z there are
several points plotted, I guess these are for various values of c at that Z?
Can we label these somehow so it's possible to see how the entropy jump
varies with c at fixed Z?

On page 18, where you say "(need to show this)", isn't this clear since the
linear theory applies by definition to sufficiently small amplitude
perturbations?

On p. 18, "we may expect that the shock will also travel at an effective
velocity; it is natural to suppose that this velocity will be related to the
Rankine-Hungoniot shock speed ..."
It's not clear to me why this is natural to expect?

In the xlabel of Fig 15, do you mean "effective shock speed"?
