\subsection{Numerical discretization\label{discretization}}
Before continuing, we briefly describe the numerical methods used for the
computations presented in this work.  The methods employed are both
finite volume Godunov-type
high-resolution methods, which employ Riemann solvers and nonlinear limiters
to obtain good resolution of shocks or steep gradients without spurious
oscillations.  

The first method used is that implemented in Clawpack \cite{clawpack45}
and described in \cite{leveque1997}.  Briefly, this is a second-order TVD
high-resolution scheme based on Lax-Wendroff discretization with limiters.

The second method used is that implemented in the SharpClaw software package
\cite{sharpclaw} and described in \cite{ketcheson2006,ketcheson2011}.  
This involves a method-of-lines
discretization approach, using WENO reconstruction in space and high order
Runge-Kutta time integration.  In all experiments with SharpClaw we use the
fourth-order SSP Runge-Kutta scheme of \cite{ketcheson2008} and fifth-order 
WENO reconstruction \cite{shu2009}.
